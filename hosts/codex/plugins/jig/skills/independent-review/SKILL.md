## What this skill does

Constructs the standardized reviewer-subagent prompt and tells Codex when /
how to spawn the Task. The skill has four modes, matching the review passes
every slice may run:

- **Implementation review** — after the implementer writes the deliverable to
  disk. The reviewer evaluates each acceptance criterion against the actual
  files; returns `pass | fail | needs-changes`. This is the **compliance
  pass** in spec-workflow's multi-pass flow.
- **Pr-review (craft pass)** — slice 031-01. After the compliance pass
  returns, the orchestrator runs a craft-pass review that produces the
  four-bucket output (scope / blockers / nits / strengths) the
  `jig:pr-review` skill emits, wrapped in the same verdict envelope as the
  compliance pass. SPECIFIC ISSUES entries are tagged `[blocker]` / `[nit]`
  / `[strength]` so the workflow can decide what blocks the REVIEWED
  transition vs. what becomes a reconciliation-log entry.
- **Arch-review (architecture pass — on-demand)** — slice 031-02. After
  the craft pass returns, the orchestrator queries the slice's
  `arch_review:` frontmatter flag via `workflow.py arch-review-needed`;
  when `true`, it runs an arch pass producing the four-bucket output
  (summary / strengths / concerns / open questions) the
  `jig:arch-review` skill emits, in the same verdict envelope. Slice
  authors set `arch_review: true` in the slice's frontmatter when the
  slice changes module boundaries, public contracts, or
  architecture-shaped concerns; the slice template at
  `templates/docs/specs/slice-template.md` ships the field commented
  out as a discoverability nudge.
- **Design-review (attest-only pass — on-demand)** — slice 071-01 /
  ADR-0022. After the craft (+ arch) passes, the orchestrator queries the
  slice's `design_review:` flag via `workflow.py design-review-needed`;
  when `true`, it runs an **attest-only** pass: the read-only reviewer
  attests an external, non-deterministic design-fidelity eval's frozen
  verdict (e.g. servo's `.servo/design-eval/` composite ≥ its own
  threshold, non-stale, `env_error` ≠ pass) and records pass/fail — it
  never re-runs or re-derives the score (servo runs/scores, jig attests).
  Gates REVIEWED like arch. Authors set `design_review: true` when the
  slice ships UI gated by an external design-fidelity eval — and the slice
  body must point at **where the eval evidence lives** (the frozen config +
  threshold and the results ledger), since the reviewer can only attest a
  verdict it can locate; with no pointer it has nothing to read and records
  a `fail`.
- **Reconciliation review** — after the deviation log is written. The
  reviewer verifies the doc changes match reality; does NOT re-review the ACs.

`review.py` builds the prompt text; `agents/reviewer.md` defines the agent's
tool restrictions and persistent system rules.

## How to use

### Task telemetry tags

When you feed a `review.py` prompt to the `Task` tool, prefix the prompt with
the compact attribution tags that `jig-telemetry.sh` records:

```text
[jig:phase=<phase>] [jig:spec=NNN] [jig:slice=NNN-NN]

<review.py prompt body>
```

Use `compliance` for `review.py implementation`, `craft` for `pr-review`,
`arch` for `arch-review`, `code-health` for `code-health`,
`frame-critique` for frame critique, and `reconciliation` for
reconciliation review. These tags make later token reports price the workflow
phase, not just the subagent type.

> **Always pass `spec.md`, in every recipe below.** The helper resolves which
> file actually holds the named slice — a sibling `slice-NN-<short>.md` under
> the file-per-slice layout, or the `## Slice` section of `spec.md` under the
> embedded one — and points the reviewer at that file, with `spec.md` trailing
> as context. Do not hand-substitute the slice path (bug 019).

### Implementation review

After the implementer has written the deliverable to disk:

```bash
PROMPT=$(python3 "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/independent-review/review.py" \
  implementation \
  "docs/specs/NNN-<slug>/spec.md" \
  "<slice-fragment>" \
  "<deliverable-path-1>" "<deliverable-path-2>" ...)
SUBAGENT=$(python3 "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/independent-review/review.py" \
  subagent-type implementation)
```

Then feed `[jig:phase=compliance] [jig:spec=NNN]
[jig:slice=NNN-NN]\n\n$PROMPT` to the `Task` tool with
`subagent_type: "$SUBAGENT"`. The helper resolves `$SUBAGENT`
deterministically — `reviewer` when jig is installed as a plugin (the real
filesystem-based agent is reachable), `general-purpose` when running from
source. Wait for the verdict. Address any `fail`/`needs-changes` findings;
rerun the helper + Task as needed until `pass`.

### Pr-review (craft pass — slice 031-01)

After the compliance pass returns `pass`, run the craft pass:

```bash
PROMPT=$(python3 "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/independent-review/review.py" \
  pr-review \
  "docs/specs/NNN-<slug>/spec.md" \
  "<slice-fragment>" \
  "<deliverable-path-1>" "<deliverable-path-2>" ...)
SUBAGENT=$(python3 "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/independent-review/review.py" \
  subagent-type pr-review)
```

Feed `[jig:phase=craft] [jig:spec=NNN] [jig:slice=NNN-NN]\n\n$PROMPT` to
`Task` with `subagent_type: "$SUBAGENT"`. The prompt points the reviewer at
the most-specific `pr-review` SKILL.md reachable in the environment —
Codex's skill router resolves user > project > `jig:pr-review` precedence
via the skill description hints. The pass returns the canonical four output
buckets (scope / blockers / nits / strengths) wrapped in the same verdict
envelope as the compliance pass. SPECIFIC ISSUES entries are tagged
`[blocker]` / `[nit]` / `[strength]`; only `[blocker]` entries block the
REVIEWED transition.

### Arch-review (architecture pass — slice 031-02, on-demand)

The arch pass runs only when the slice's frontmatter declares
`arch_review: true`. Query the flag via `workflow.py arch-review-needed`
before spawning:

```bash
# Capture the helper exit code — a non-zero exit means the slice lookup
# failed, not "no arch pass needed." Surface the error rather than
# silently skipping the pass.
if ! NEED_ARCH=$(python3 "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/spec-workflow/workflow.py" \
    arch-review-needed \
    "docs/specs/NNN-<slug>/spec.md" \
    "<slice-fragment>"); then
  echo "arch-review-needed failed — aborting" >&2
  exit 2
fi
if [ "$NEED_ARCH" = "true" ]; then
  PROMPT=$(python3 "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/independent-review/review.py" \
    arch-review \
    "docs/specs/NNN-<slug>/spec.md" \
    "<slice-fragment>" \
    "<deliverable-path-1>" "<deliverable-path-2>" ...)
  SUBAGENT=$(python3 "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/independent-review/review.py" \
    subagent-type arch-review)
fi
```

When `$NEED_ARCH` is `true`, feed `[jig:phase=arch] [jig:spec=NNN]
[jig:slice=NNN-NN]\n\n$PROMPT` to `Task` with
`subagent_type: "$SUBAGENT"`. The prompt routes via the same prose-based
dispatch as `pr-review` to the most-specific `arch-review` SKILL.md
reachable. The pass returns the canonical four arch output buckets (summary /
strengths / concerns / open questions). Tag and block semantics match the
craft pass: `[blocker]` entries block the REVIEWED transition; `[nit]`
entries and `needs-changes` become reconciliation-log items.

Slice authors set `arch_review: true` in the slice file's frontmatter
when the slice changes module boundaries, public contracts, or
architecture-shaped concerns. The slice template ships the field
commented out as a discoverability nudge.

### Frame-critique (adversarial pass — slice 064-03 / ADR-0020, on-demand)

Unlike every other pass, frame-critique runs **PRE-implementation** — it
gates the `DRAFT → READY_FOR_REVIEW` transition of a spec/slice (or, once
[064-05](../../docs/specs/064-spec-frame-hardening/slice-05-adr-accept-gate.md)
lands, an ADR at `adr.py accept`), before any code exists. Its job is
**adversarial**, not conformance: a fresh reviewer hunts the single
load-bearing assumption most likely to be **wrong** and argues why, so a
bad *premise* is caught at authoring time (the cheapest point) rather than
executed with discipline. It runs only when the artifact declares a truthy
`frame_review` flag.

```bash
PROMPT=$(python3 "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/independent-review/review.py" \
  frame-critique \
  "docs/specs/NNN-<slug>/spec.md" \
  "<slice-fragment>" \
  "<deliverable-path>" ...)
SUBAGENT=$(python3 "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/independent-review/review.py" \
  subagent-type)
```

Feed `[jig:phase=frame-critique] [jig:spec=NNN]
[jig:slice=NNN-NN]\n\n$PROMPT` to `Task` with
`subagent_type: "$SUBAGENT"`.

Record the verdict as the `frame-critique` pass (below); the
`READY_FOR_REVIEW` gate requires it iff `frame_review` is truthy
(default-off artifacts transition freely). **Model policy (ADR-0020):**
run frame-critique **equal-or-stronger** than the artifact's author —
**never downgrade it for cost** (the one pass whose value is adversarial
depth). 064-03 ships rung-1 (fresh-context subagent) independence;
cross-model (rung-3) is deferred (`docs/refinement-todo.md`).

### Design-review (attest-only pass — slice 071-01 / ADR-0022, on-demand)

Unlike every other pass, design-review produces no judgment of its own — it
**attests** an *external, non-deterministic* eval's frozen verdict. The eval
(e.g. servo's design-fidelity oracle) is the thing that RUNS the UI and SCORES
it against a frozen design definition; this pass's read-only reviewer confirms,
by reading the recorded eval evidence, that the eval actually **RAN**, is
**NON-STALE** (its frozen config/threshold unchanged since the run), is
**HONEST** (an `env_error` / infra failure is **not** a pass and **not** a
0.0), and that the latest composite is **≥ the eval's own declared threshold** —
then RECORDS that verdict. It **never re-runs, re-derives, or re-judges** the
score: servo runs and scores, jig attests (the ADR-0022 honesty boundary). It
runs only when the slice declares a truthy `design_review` flag, and gates
REVIEWED exactly like `arch`.

```bash
PROMPT=$(python3 "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/independent-review/review.py" \
  design-review \
  "docs/specs/NNN-<slug>/spec.md" \
  "<slice-fragment>" \
  "<deliverable-path>" ...)
```

Record the verdict as the `design-review` pass; the `REVIEWED` gate requires it
iff `design_review` is truthy (default-off slices transition freely). Although
the shared envelope offers `pass | fail | needs-changes`, an attestation is
binary — the recorded eval verdict either attests (honest, non-stale, meets its
threshold) or it does not — so this pass meaningfully emits only `pass` / `fail`
(the gate clears on `pass` and blocks on either of the others). **No
richer-skill detection** — there is no external "design-review" skill category;
the pass attests jig's own eval evidence. First consumer: food-log slice 002-01
(servo design-fidelity eval).

> The `design_review` flag is set **by hand** on a slice/spec whose deliverable
> is validated by an external design-fidelity eval — there is **no** mechanical
> derivation (unlike `frame_review`, which slice 064-04 derives from the spec's
> grounding). Once set, `workflow.py session-plan` surfaces the pass on the
> dispatch plan so it isn't a dead loop.

### Reconciliation review

After the deviation log subsection has been added under the slice — in its
`slice-NN-<short>.md` file, or under the `## Slice` section in `spec.md` in the
embedded layout:

```bash
PROMPT=$(python3 "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/independent-review/review.py" \
  reconciliation \
  "docs/specs/NNN-<slug>/spec.md" \
  "<slice-fragment>")
SUBAGENT=$(python3 "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/independent-review/review.py" \
  subagent-type reconciliation)
```

Feed `[jig:phase=reconciliation] [jig:spec=NNN]
[jig:slice=NNN-NN]\n\n$PROMPT` to `Task` with
`subagent_type: "$SUBAGENT"`. The prompt explicitly tells the reviewer NOT to
re-evaluate against ACs — it only verifies the deviation log matches reality.

### Recording and checking review evidence (slice 045-02)

A review pass is durable evidence, not ephemeral chat. After a pass
returns a verdict, record it as a file beside the slice it grades, at
`docs/specs/NNN-<slug>/reviews/slice-NN-<pass>.md` (ADR-0014 §1). The
schema (`pass ∈ {compliance, craft, arch, code-health, frame-critique,
reconciliation}`,
`verdict ∈ {pass, fail, needs-changes}`, plus `reviewer`, `reviewed_at`,
`prompt_source`) lives in `skills/_common/review_evidence.py` so the
slice 045-03 transition gate validates the same shape.

Record a verdict. The freeform body is **required** and comes from
`--summary-file PATH`, or from stdin with `--summary-file -` — a verdict
with no body is refused. `record-review` never reads stdin unless asked
(bug 017: the old implicit fallback blocked forever on a pipe nobody
closed, hanging CI and agent harnesses):

```bash
python3 "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/independent-review/review.py" \
  record-review \
  "docs/specs/NNN-<slug>/spec.md" \
  "<slice-fragment>" \
  --pass compliance \
  --verdict pass \
  --reviewer jig:reviewer \
  --prompt-source "review.py implementation ..." \
  --summary-file verdict.md
```

Re-recording the same `(slice, pass)` **overwrites in place** — git
history is the audit trail, there is no append (ADR-0014 §4). A
`fail`/`needs-changes` that has not been overwritten by a later `pass`
therefore still blocks the gate, which is exactly the "superseded
without a later pass" case.

Validate the evidence set for a slice at a transition stage:

```bash
python3 "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/independent-review/review.py" \
  check-reviews \
  "docs/specs/NNN-<slug>/spec.md" \
  "<slice-fragment>" \
  --stage REVIEWED   # or RECONCILED
```

`check-reviews` exits `0` when the required passes for the stage all
clear (`REVIEWED` → compliance + craft, plus arch iff the slice declares
`arch_review: true`; `RECONCILED` → reconciliation), or `2` with
actionable diagnostics for missing files, malformed frontmatter, unknown
pass/verdict values, non-clearing (superseded-only) verdicts, and invalid
slice targets. The gate rule is uniform: a pass clears iff `verdict: pass`
(ADR-0014 §3). **Code-staleness** (a `pass` artifact predating a later
deliverable change) is deliberately NOT checked — it is a deferred
enhancement (ADR-0014 Scope).

**The full enforced flow.** build prompt (`review.py implementation` /
`pr-review` / `arch-review`) → spawn reviewer → `record-review` the
verdict → `check-reviews` (optional preflight) → `workflow.py transition
… REVIEWED` (or `RECONCILED` / `DONE`). The transition imports the same
validator `check-reviews` uses, so the gate and this skill agree by
construction. A refused transition names the missing/invalid artifact and
the `record-review` command to produce it; a deliberate out-of-band flow
bypasses the gate with `JIG_REVIEW_EVIDENCE_GATE=0`. **Recovering from a
failed review:** address the findings, re-run the pass, `record-review`
again (overwrites the earlier file for that `(slice, pass)` in place — git
history is the audit trail), then re-run the transition; with every
required pass now `pass`, the gate clears.

### What gets put in the prompt automatically

- Standard preamble ("You are seeing this work for the first time")
- The slice's full label (helper looks it up from the spec)
- "What you must NOT do" block (no prior reasoning, no soften, no file writes,
  no `docs/memory/` writes)
- Canonical output format (`VERDICT | REASONING | SPECIFIC ISSUES | RECONCILIATION NOTES`)

## Context isolation pattern

Implementer writes deliverable to disk → `review.py` builds a self-contained
prompt → Codex spawns the reviewer Task with that prompt → reviewer reads
only what the prompt points at. This is imperfect (parent context is
technically accessible to subagents — see GitHub issue #20304), but works
reliably when the prompt is sharp.

## Gotchas

- **`review.py` does not spawn the Task.** It only constructs the prompt
  string. Codex is responsible for invoking the `Task` tool with the prompt
  as the `prompt` parameter. This separation keeps `review.py` deterministic
  and testable.
- **Reviewer agent is read-only by definition.** `agents/reviewer.md` lists
  only `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep` in its tool set. No `Write` or `Edit`.
- **Reviewer must not write to `docs/memory/`.** Defining the glossary,
  capturing learnings, or modifying the hot cache is `memory-sync`'s job,
  not the reviewer's.
- **Reconciliation review never re-evaluates ACs.** That's done. The
  reconciliation prompt explicitly states this so the reviewer doesn't
  drift into AC-re-review.
- **Substring matching for slice fragments** is identical to `workflow.py` —
  `001-01` matches `## Slice 001-01 — greenfield-scaffold`. Ambiguous
  fragments are refused with exit 2.
